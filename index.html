The user has confirmed that the "Web into App" wrapper tool has an "Add Audio Permissions" setting enabled. This might allow native microphone access, but it is not guaranteed to handle the `WebChromeClient` permission bridge correctly.

Please refactor the `Recorder` component to use a **"Hybrid Fail-Safe" approach**.

### Requirements:

1.  **Priority 1: Attempt Direct Recording (WebRTC)**
    *   Restore the `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` and `MediaRecorder` logic.
    *   When the "Start Singing" button is clicked, first try to initialize the direct microphone stream.
    *   Use `MediaRecorder.isTypeSupported` to find a supported mime type (e.g., webm, mp4, aac) to avoid codec errors on Android.

2.  **Priority 2: Fallback to Native Capture (Input File)**
    *   Keep the hidden `<input type="file" accept="audio/*" capture="microphone" />` element.
    *   Wrap the `getUserMedia` call in a `try-catch` block.
    *   **CRITICAL:** If `getUserMedia` fails (throws an error) OR if the stream cannot be started, **automatically** programmatically trigger `.click()` on the hidden file input.
    *   This ensures that if the specific Android WebView wrapper fails to bridge the permission, the user is immediately presented with the system recorder/file picker instead of a dead button.

3.  **UI/UX Preservation**
    *   Keep the text scaling fixes (using `vw` units for the timer and `min-width`/scroll for the tabs) from the previous update as they are working perfectly.
    *   If direct recording starts, show the live timer.
    *   If falling back to file input, show a "Select Recording" or "Processing..." state.

4.  **Error Handling Alert**
    *   If falling back to the file input, optionally show a fleeting `alert("Switching to native recorder...")` or `console.log` so the user knows why the behavior changed.

Please verify the code is still a single `index.html` file using React and Tailwind.
